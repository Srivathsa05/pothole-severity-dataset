Pothole Severity Classification Dataset
This repository contains a custom‑curated dataset for pothole severity analysis, designed for hybrid quantum–classical machine learning research.

📌 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three severity classes of road images:

No Pothole — 720 images

Less Severe Pothole — 800 images

Severe Pothole — 1400 images

Images were collected from:

RDD 2022 Dataset

Publicly available road‑condition sources

Smartphone and dashcam captures

All images were resized to 224×224 and organized into class‑specific folders.

🔍 Usage
This dataset supports tasks including:

Pothole detection

Severity classification

Feature extraction (ResNet‑based)

PCA dimensionality reduction

Quantum circuit encoding (RY‑based encoding)
